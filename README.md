# SupermarketListApp
This is a Mobile App project I created in college using a Kotlin example code provided from the teacher called "Placemark".

I used Android Studio as an editor here, and virtual Machine/emulator (provided in Android Studio) for running and testing this program.

the language used is here is Kotlin.



#Features         
This app can do the basic CRUD functionality, Create, read, update and delete.
- it will opens the add product functionality when you click in the + button


#Knowing bugs   
-The items added before will not show to you before you try to add an product and cancel it or before you add one product. 

#Points to improve    

- welcome screen need to be added
- first use tutorial will be ideal

I need to work much more in the UX (user experience), for this app, once I think is not very intuitive and easy to use as it should
Statistics features like add up the price of the products, identify where you are expending more and a sharing functionality will be ideal for the main purpose of this app. 

the functionality that allows the user to take the photo of the product inside my app, will be better for the purpose of this app than having just the add the saved image from the phone.
